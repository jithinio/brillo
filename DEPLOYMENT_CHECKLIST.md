# Multi-Project Types System - Deployment Checklist

## üöÄ Pre-Deployment Verification

### ‚úÖ Code Review Checklist
- [ ] All new TypeScript interfaces are properly typed
- [ ] Backwards compatibility layer is complete
- [ ] Database migration script is tested and safe
- [ ] Error handling is comprehensive
- [ ] Performance optimizations are in place
- [ ] Security validations are implemented

### ‚úÖ Testing Checklist
- [ ] Migration test script passes (`node scripts/test-multi-project-migration.js`)
- [ ] All existing functionality works unchanged
- [ ] New project types can be created successfully
- [ ] Auto-calculation engine works correctly
- [ ] UI components render properly
- [ ] API endpoints return expected data formats

### ‚úÖ Database Checklist
- [ ] Migration script reviewed and approved
- [ ] Backup strategy in place before migration
- [ ] All indexes are created for performance
- [ ] Constraints are properly set
- [ ] Triggers are working correctly

## üìã Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Database Migration
```bash
# 1. Create database backup
pg_dump your_database > backup_before_migration.sql

# 2. Run migration script
psql -f scripts/31-add-multi-project-types.sql

# 3. Verify migration
node scripts/test-multi-project-migration.js

# 4. Check data integrity
SELECT project_type, COUNT(*) FROM projects GROUP BY project_type;
```

### Step 2: Code Deployment
```bash
# 1. Deploy new code (zero-downtime deployment)
npm run build
npm run deploy

# 2. Verify deployment health
curl /api/health

# 3. Test backwards compatibility
curl /api/projects # Should return familiar format
```

### Step 3: Feature Rollout
```bash
# 1. Enable new features gradually
# Start with internal testing
# Monitor for any issues
# Gradually roll out to all users
```

## üîç Post-Deployment Monitoring

### Immediate Checks (First 24 hours)
- [ ] Monitor error rates in logs
- [ ] Verify database performance metrics
- [ ] Check that existing users can still access projects
- [ ] Confirm new project creation works
- [ ] Monitor calculation engine performance

### Metrics to Monitor
```sql
-- Project type distribution
SELECT project_type, COUNT(*) as count 
FROM projects 
GROUP BY project_type;

-- Auto-calculation usage
SELECT auto_calculate_total, COUNT(*) as count
FROM projects 
GROUP BY auto_calculate_total;

-- Performance check
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM projects WHERE project_type = 'recurring';
```

### Health Checks
```javascript
// Application health check
const healthCheck = {
  database: 'Connected',
  projectTypes: ['fixed', 'recurring', 'hourly'],
  calculationEngine: 'Running',
  backwardsCompatibility: 'Active'
}
```

## üö® Rollback Plan

### If Issues Arise
1. **Stop deployment immediately**
2. **Restore from backup if needed**
3. **Disable new features while investigating**
4. **Monitor user impact**

### Rollback Commands
```bash
# Emergency rollback
psql < backup_before_migration.sql

# Or selective rollback
ALTER TABLE projects DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS project_type;
ALTER TABLE projects DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS total_budget;
# ... etc
```

## üìä Success Criteria

### Technical Success
- [ ] Zero data loss during migration
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved
- [ ] New features working as designed
- [ ] Performance within acceptable limits
- [ ] No increase in error rates

### User Success  
- [ ] Users can create all project types
- [ ] Existing projects display correctly
- [ ] Auto-calculations work intuitively
- [ ] UI is responsive and clear
- [ ] No user complaints about missing data

## üéØ Feature Adoption Strategy

### Phase 1: Soft Launch (Week 1)
- Enable new features for admin users only
- Monitor system performance and user feedback
- Fix any minor issues discovered

### Phase 2: Gradual Rollout (Week 2-3)
- Enable for pilot group of users
- Provide training materials
- Collect feedback and iterate

### Phase 3: Full Rollout (Week 4+)
- Enable for all users
- Announce new features
- Provide comprehensive documentation

## üîß Configuration Options

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Feature flags
ENABLE_MULTI_PROJECT_TYPES=true
ENABLE_AUTO_CALCULATION=true
CALCULATION_CACHE_TTL=300000 # 5 minutes

# Performance tuning
PROJECT_BATCH_SIZE=50
CALCULATION_QUEUE_SIZE=100
```

### Database Configuration
```sql
-- Adjust if needed for performance
SET work_mem = '256MB';
SET shared_buffers = '1GB';
```

## üìû Support Contacts

### Team Responsibilities
- **Database Issues**: DBA Team
- **Application Issues**: Development Team  
- **User Issues**: Support Team
- **Performance Issues**: DevOps Team

### Escalation Path
1. First responder investigates
2. Escalate to development team if code-related
3. Escalate to DBA if database-related
4. Escalate to management if major impact
