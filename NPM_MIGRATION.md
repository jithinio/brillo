# NPM Migration - Vercel Deployment Fix

## Problem
Vercel deployment was failing with the error:
```
Error: Lockfile is out of sync with package.json
5 new dependencies were added to package.json but not to pnpm-lock.yaml
```

The issue was that new dependencies were added to `package.json` but the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file wasn't updated, causing a mismatch.

## Solution
Switched from pnpm to npm to resolve the deployment issue.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed pnpm files
- Deleted `pnpm-lock.yaml`

### 2. Generated npm lockfile
- Ran `npm install` to generate `package-lock.json`
- All dependencies are now properly locked with npm

### 3. Fixed character encoding issue
- Fixed strange character `¸` in `lib/utils.ts` that was causing build errors
- File now has proper UTF-8 encoding

## Files Changed

### Removed
- `pnpm-lock.yaml` - pnpm lockfile (deleted)

### Added
- `package-lock.json` - npm lockfile (generated)

### Modified
- `lib/utils.ts` - Fixed character encoding issue

## Verification

### Build Test
```bash
npm run build
# ✅ Compiled successfully in 1000ms
# ✅ All 23 pages generated successfully
# ✅ No errors or warnings
```

### Dependencies
All dependencies are properly installed and locked:
- ✅ `@dnd-kit/core@^6.3.1`
- ✅ `@dnd-kit/sortable@^10.0.0` 
- ✅ `@dnd-kit/utilities@^3.2.2`
- ✅ `canvas-confetti@^1.9.3`
- ✅ `@types/canvas-confetti@^1.9.0`
- ✅ All other dependencies

## Vercel Deployment

The project is now ready for Vercel deployment:
- ✅ Uses npm (Vercel's default package manager)
- ✅ Lockfile is in sync with package.json
- ✅ Build completes successfully
- ✅ All dependencies properly resolved

## Next Steps

1. **Commit the changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Switch to npm and fix Vercel deployment"
   git push
   ```

2. **Redeploy on Vercel:**
   - The deployment should now succeed automatically
   - No additional configuration needed

## Benefits of npm

- ✅ **Vercel native support** - npm is Vercel's default package manager
- ✅ **Better compatibility** - fewer deployment issues
- ✅ **Simpler setup** - no need for pnpm-specific configuration
- ✅ **Wide adoption** - most developers are familiar with npm

## Migration Complete

The project has been successfully migrated from pnpm to npm and is ready for deployment on Vercel.
