# Vercel Chromium PDF Generation Troubleshooting

## 🚨 Current Status

The PDF generation system has been upgraded with comprehensive debugging and fallback mechanisms to resolve the Chromium binary path issue in Vercel production environments.

## 📋 What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced Path Resolution** (`lib/pdf-browser.ts`)
- ✅ Comprehensive directory scanning and debugging
- ✅ Multiple fallback paths for different serverless environments
- ✅ Vercel-specific path detection
- ✅ System chromium fallback
- ✅ Alternative extraction methods

### 2. **Vercel Configuration** (`vercel.json`)
- ✅ Increased memory allocation (1024MB)
- ✅ Extended timeout (30 seconds)
- ✅ Build environment optimization

### 3. **Package Configuration** (`package.json`)
- ✅ pnpm overrides for chromium version
- ✅ Hybrid puppeteer setup (dev + production)

## 🔍 Debug Information

When the issue occurs, check the Vercel Function logs for detailed debugging information:

```
🔍 Chromium debugging info:
- Platform: linux
- Architecture: x64
- Node version: v18.x.x
- Working directory: /var/task
- __dirname: /var/task/.next/server/app/api/generate-pdf
- process.env.VERCEL: 1
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Steps

### Step 1: Check Function Logs
1. Go to your Vercel Dashboard
2. Navigate to **Functions** tab
3. Click on the failed function execution
4. Look for the comprehensive debugging output

### Step 2: If Path Resolution Fails
If you see "Could not find Chromium executable", the logs will show:
- All directories checked
- Which paths were attempted
- Whether any chromium-related files were found

### Step 3: Alternative Solutions

If the issue persists, try these approaches:

#### Option A: Manual Chromium Binary
```bash
# Add to your project root
pnpm add @sparticuz/chromium-min
```

Then update `lib/pdf-browser.ts`:
```typescript
// Replace the chromium import with:
const chromium = (await import('@sparticuz/chromium-min')).default
```

#### Option B: Use Playwright (Alternative)
```bash
# Alternative PDF generation
pnpm remove @sparticuz/chromium puppeteer-core
pnpm add playwright-core playwright-aws-lambda
```

#### Option C: Different Chromium Version
```bash
# Try older version that might work better
pnpm remove @sparticuz/chromium
pnpm add @sparticuz/chromium@126.0.0
```

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

### Development (Local)
- Uses regular `puppeteer` with bundled Chromium
- Should work without any issues

### Production (Vercel)
- Uses `puppeteer-core` + `@sparticuz/chromium`
- Comprehensive path resolution with fallbacks
- Detailed debugging information in logs

## 📊 Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "spawn ENOEXEC" | Use regular puppeteer (development) |
| "Binary not found" | Check Vercel function logs for path details |
| "Timeout" | Increase memory in vercel.json |
| "Memory limit" | Reduce concurrent operations |

## 🔧 Quick Fixes

### 1. Force Chromium Installation
```bash
# Clear cache and reinstall
pnpm store prune
pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile
```

### 2. Verify Vercel Configuration
Ensure your `vercel.json` has:
```json
{
  "functions": {
    "app/api/generate-pdf/route.ts": {
      "maxDuration": 30,
      "memory": 1024
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Check Build Environment
Add to your Vercel environment variables:
```
PUPPETEER_SKIP_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD=true
```

## 📞 Support

If the issue persists after trying all solutions:

1. **Check the Function Logs** - The detailed debugging will show exactly what's happening
2. **Try Alternative Approaches** - Consider using different packages or versions
3. **Gradual Rollback** - Start with simpler PDF generation and add complexity

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

Before deploying:
- [ ] Build succeeds locally (`pnpm build`)
- [ ] All dependencies are correctly installed
- [ ] Vercel.json is properly configured
- [ ] Environment variables are set
- [ ] Function memory and timeout are adequate

## 📝 Current Implementation Status

✅ **Implemented**: Comprehensive debugging and fallback system  
✅ **Configured**: Vercel-specific optimizations  
✅ **Ready**: For production deployment with detailed error reporting  

The system will now provide extensive debugging information to help identify and resolve any remaining issues in the Vercel environment.
