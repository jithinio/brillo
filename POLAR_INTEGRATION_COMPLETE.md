NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_PRO_FEATURES=true
```

### 2. **Polar Account Setup**
1. **Create Polar Account**: Go to [polar.sh](https://polar.sh) and sign up
2. **Create Organization**: Add your business details
3. **Create Products**:
   - **Pro Monthly**: $10.00/month
   - **Pro Yearly**: $96.00/year ($8/month, save 2 months)
4. **Get Access Token**: Create an Organization Access Token from your organization settings
5. **Setup Webhook**: Point to `https://yourdomain.com/api/polar/webhook`

### 3. **Database Migration**
Run the subscription tables migration:

```bash
# Connect to your Supabase SQL editor and run:
# scripts/30-add-subscription-support.sql
```

### 4. **Test the Integration**

#### **Test Free Plan Limits**
1. Visit `/dashboard` - should show free plan features
2. Go to `/dashboard/invoices` - should show upgrade prompt
3. Go to `/dashboard/analytics` - should show upgrade prompt
4. Check Settings → Subscription tab - shows current plan info

#### **Test Upgrade Flow**
1. Visit `/pricing` - should show all plans
2. Click "Upgrade to Pro" on any paid plan
3. Should redirect to Polar checkout
4. Complete test purchase (use test card: 4242 4242 4242 4242)
5. Should redirect back with success message
6. Verify access to Pro features

#### **Test Pro Features**
1. All invoice functionality should now work
2. Advanced analytics should be accessible
3. Invoice customization should be available
4. Settings should show Pro plan status

### 5. **Webhook Testing**
Test webhook events work properly:
1. Subscribe to a plan
2. Check Supabase - user should have Pro status
3. Cancel subscription through customer portal
4. User should revert to free plan

## 🔍 **How It Works**

### **User Flow**
1. **Free User** sees Pro badges and upgrade prompts
2. **Clicks Upgrade** → redirected to Polar checkout
3. **Completes Payment** → webhook updates database
4. **User Returns** → now has Pro access

### **Technical Flow**
1. `SubscriptionProvider` manages subscription state
2. Feature gates check subscription before rendering
3. Pro badges show only to free users
4. Webhooks keep subscription data synchronized

### **Security Features**
- ✅ Webhook signature validation
- ✅ Server-side subscription verification
- ✅ Safe fallbacks if services are down
- ✅ Row-level security on subscription data

## 📞 **Support & Customization**

### **Common Customizations**
- **Change Plan Prices**: Update in `lib/subscription-plans.ts`
- **Add New Features**: Add to plan limits and feature gates
- **Modify UI**: Update pricing cards and feature gates
- **Change Trial Period**: Modify plan configurations

### **Monitoring**

## 🚀 **Go Live Ready!**

Your subscription system is production-ready! Just:
