# User Data Isolation Migration

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Security Update

Your application currently has a **critical security issue** where all users can see each other's data. This migration fixes that by implementing proper user isolation.

## What the Problem Is

Currently, when you create a new account and login, you can see data from other accounts because:
- All projects, clients, invoices belong to everyone
- There's no user-specific data filtering
- User accounts are isolated but their data is not

## What This Migration Does

This migration adds **proper user isolation** so that:
- ‚úÖ Each user only sees their own clients
- ‚úÖ Each user only sees their own projects  
- ‚úÖ Each user only sees their own invoices
- ‚úÖ Data is completely private between accounts
- ‚úÖ New data automatically belongs to the current user

## How to Apply the Migration

### Step 1: Run the Database Migration

1. Go to your **Supabase Dashboard** ‚Üí **SQL Editor**
2. Open the file `scripts/16-add-user-isolation.sql` from this project
3. Copy the entire SQL content and paste it into the SQL Editor
4. Click **"Run"** to execute the migration

### Step 2: Handle Existing Data (Important!)

If you have existing data in your database, you need to decide what to do with it:

#### Option A: Delete All Existing Data (Recommended for Testing)
```sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor to clear all data
DELETE FROM invoice_items;
DELETE FROM invoices;  
DELETE FROM projects;
DELETE FROM clients;
```

#### Option B: Assign Existing Data to a Specific User
```sql
-- First, find your user ID
SELECT id, email FROM auth.users;

-- Then assign all existing data to your user ID (replace 'your-user-id-here')
UPDATE clients SET user_id = 'your-user-id-here' WHERE user_id IS NULL;
UPDATE projects SET user_id = 'your-user-id-here' WHERE user_id IS NULL;
UPDATE invoices SET user_id = 'your-user-id-here' WHERE user_id IS NULL;
UPDATE invoice_items SET user_id = 'your-user-id-here' WHERE user_id IS NULL;
```

### Step 3: Make User ID Required (Optional)
After handling existing data, you can make user_id required:

```sql
-- Uncomment and run these lines in SQL Editor
ALTER TABLE clients ALTER COLUMN user_id SET NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE projects ALTER COLUMN user_id SET NOT NULL; 
ALTER TABLE invoices ALTER COLUMN user_id SET NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE invoice_items ALTER COLUMN user_id SET NOT NULL;
```

## What Changes in the Application

After the migration:

1. **New Data**: All new clients, projects, and invoices will automatically be assigned to the current user
2. **Viewing Data**: Users will only see their own data
3. **Sharing**: No data is shared between different user accounts
4. **No Code Changes**: The application code doesn't need to change - it's handled by database policies

## Testing the Migration

1. **Before Migration**: 
   - Create two different accounts
   - Notice both accounts see the same data ‚ùå

2. **After Migration**:
   - Create data in Account A
   - Login to Account B 
   - Account B should NOT see Account A's data ‚úÖ
   - Create different data in Account B
   - Login back to Account A
   - Account A should only see its own data ‚úÖ

## Rollback (Emergency Only)

If something goes wrong, you can rollback by running:

```sql
-- Emergency rollback - restores public access
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own clients" ON clients;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert their own clients" ON clients;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own clients" ON clients;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own clients" ON clients;

CREATE POLICY "Enable read access for all users" ON clients FOR SELECT USING (true);
CREATE POLICY "Enable insert for all users" ON clients FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (true);
CREATE POLICY "Enable update for all users" ON clients FOR UPDATE USING (true);
CREATE POLICY "Enable delete for all users" ON clients FOR DELETE USING (true);

-- Repeat for projects, invoices, invoice_items tables
```

## Support

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify the migration completed successfully in Supabase logs
3. Ensure you're logged in with a valid user account
4. Try creating new data to test the isolation

**Remember**: This is a critical security fix that ensures your application data is properly private and secure! üîí
